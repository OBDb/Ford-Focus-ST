    description: "The original Focus ST, known as the ST170 in Europe and SVT Focus in North America (2001-2005), was Ford's first global performance variant of the Focus. Powered by a specially-tuned 2.0L Zetec engine producing 170 PS (168 HP) in European form and 170 HP in North American specification, it featured a 6-speed Getrag manual transmission. Chassis upgrades included stiffer suspension, larger brakes, and 17-inch wheels. Visual distinctions included unique front and rear bumpers, side skirts, and interior appointments including Recaro seats in some markets. This generation established the ST as a more accessible performance model positioned below the hardcore RS, offering enhanced driving dynamics and sportier styling while maintaining everyday practicality. Production continued in some markets until 2010."

Powered by a turbocharged 2.5L five-cylinder Volvo-derived engine producing 225 HP and 236 lb-ft of torque, it offered significantly enhanced performance over the previous ST170. Available in three-door, five-door, and estate (wagon) body styles, it featured sportier suspension tuning, larger brakes, and a unique bodykit. The distinctive engine note became a hallmark of this generation. The interior included Recaro sports seats, a three-spoke leather steering wheel, and additional gauges. This generation successfully established the ST as a serious contender in the hot hatch segment."

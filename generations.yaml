  - name: "First Generation (European MK1/MK2 ST170/SVT)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The original Focus ST, known as the ST170 in Europe and SVT Focus in North America, was Ford's first global performance variant of the Focus. Powered by a specially-tuned 2.0L Zetec engine producing 170 PS (168 HP) in European form and 170 HP in North American specification, it featured a 6-speed Getrag manual transmission. Chassis upgrades included stiffer suspension, larger brakes, and 17-inch wheels. Visual distinctions included unique front and rear bumpers, side skirts, and interior appointments including Recaro seats in some markets. This generation established the ST as a more accessible performance model positioned below the hardcore RS, offering enhanced driving dynamics and sportier styling while maintaining everyday practicality."

    description: "The second-generation Focus ST was initially a European-only model based on the second-generation Focus platform. Powered by a turbocharged 2.5L five-cylinder Volvo-derived engine producing 225 HP and 236 lb-ft of torque, it offered significantly enhanced performance over the previous ST170. Available in three-door, five-door, and estate (wagon) body styles, it featured sportier suspension tuning, larger brakes, and a unique bodykit. The distinctive engine note became a hallmark of this generation. The interior included Recaro sports seats, a three-spoke leather steering wheel, and additional gauges. This generation established the ST as a serious contender in the hot hatch segment, offering an appealing blend of performance, practicality, and distinctive character."

    end_year: 2018
    description: "The third-generation Focus ST became a global model as part of Ford's 'One Ford' strategy, available in North America, Europe, and other markets. Powered by a 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 252 HP and 270 lb-ft of torque, it was offered in both hatchback and estate (wagon) body styles in Europe, but only as a hatchback in North America. Performance features included torque vectoring control, a sport-tuned suspension, and variable-ratio steering. Visually distinguished by aggressive body styling, 18-inch wheels, and a center-exit exhaust, it also featured Recaro seats and ST-specific interior trim. A diesel option with a 2.0L TDCi engine producing 185 HP was added for European markets in 2014. This generation successfully balanced everyday usability with engaging performance, establishing the ST as Ford's global hot hatch."

For the first time, the ST offers a choice between a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic transmission. A diesel option continues in European markets with a 2.0L EcoBlue engine producing 190 HP. Available in five-door hatchback and estate body styles, it features an electronic limited-slip differential, continuously controlled damping, and selectable drive modes. Visually distinguished by unique bumpers, a rear spoiler, and 19-inch wheels, the interior includes heavily bolstered Recaro seats, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and ST-specific digital displays. Despite Ford's discontinuation of most car models in North America, the fourth-generation ST remains a core performance model in European and other markets, offering a sophisticated driving experience with increased technology while maintaining the engaging character that defines the ST brand."
